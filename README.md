# Splunk Lab 1

This lab demonstrates how I used Splunk to analyze and visualize log data through dashboards and filtered queries.

## Dashboards

### Events Over Time by Level
![DB Events over time by level](images/DB Events over time by level.png)
*Shows how events change over time, categorized by severity level (Info, Warn, Error).*

### Event Counts by Service
![events counts by service](images/events counts by service.png)
*Breaks down the number of events generated by each service.*

### Stats Count by Level
